# Algorand Python

Algorand Python is a partial implementation of the Python programming language that runs on the AVM. It includes a statically typed framework for development of Algorand smart contracts and logic signatures, with Pythonic interfaces to underlying AVM functionality that works with standard Python tooling.

Algorand Python is compiled for execution on the AVM by PuyaPy, an optimising compiler that ensures the resulting AVM bytecode execution semantics that match the given Python code. PuyaPy produces output that is directly compatible with [AlgoKit typed clients](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/generate.md#1-typed-clients) to make deployment and calling easy.

## Quick start

To get started refer to the [official documentation](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya).
